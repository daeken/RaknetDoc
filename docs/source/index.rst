Welcome to RaknetDoc!
=====================

**RaknetDoc** is an attempt to document Raknet as it's implemented by Minecraft Bedrock (MCPE) clients and servers as of version 1.21.50. We won't be covering any of the application-level protocol, just the Raknet transport layer. Other uses of Raknet are also out of scope for this documentation.
